Multilabel podcast classification: an esperiment with multimodal network

This repository is meant to host the end of the course project for the Machine Learning course held by prof. Andrea Asperti at the University of Bologna.
The goal of the project is to automatically infer the genre of a podcast starting from two different kinds of metadata: the cover image of the show and its textual description. In order to do so, a multimodal network was created and trained. The experiment aims at comparing the results with unimodal network that deals with only one of the two kinds of data. 
Additional information and the final results of the project can be retrieved in the PowerPoint file.
